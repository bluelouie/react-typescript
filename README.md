# express-react-typescript Template

> Simple Starter SPA Template with Typescript on both ends

> Does not use create-react-app for base configuration freedom

> Un-opinionated

This is a jumping-off project, meant to give a faster start on a new project by taking care of the configuration of the frontend and backend.

### Un-opinionated?

There is no style loader, http library, css framework, or  any other bells and whistles so you can use what you want, how you want it with no push back. 

Which is also the reason I didn't use create-react-app 

## Development
Run `npm install` to install all the packages plus all @types so Typescript wont yell at you at the start.

To start the client server to begin building your React app (with hot reload), run :

```
npm run client:watch

//--> Runs on port 8080
```

To start the server with nodemon (hot reload): 

```
npm run start:watch

//--> Runs on port 3000
```
 
An Proxy is setup so you can run API requests from the client side, without having to define another port.

```
npm run client:watch
npm run start:watch


http://localhost:8080/api/{endpoint}
```

You can define more proxies in webpack.dev

## Build

When you run `npm build` all the source code (`/src`) will be compiled and bundled into separate directories

```
dist/ <-- Complied server-side JS code
public/ <-- Bundled and minified client-side code
```
