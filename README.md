# react-typescript Template

> Simple React template with Typescript, no backend

> Does not use create-react-app for base configuration freedom

> Un-opinionated

This project was split from my Full-Stack SPA Template, which was meant to give a faster start on a new project by taking care of the configurations. 

I decided to break the template apart for specific needs. 

### Un-opinionated?

There is no style loader, http library, css framework, or  any other bells and whistles so you can use what you want, how you want it with no push back. 

Which is also the reason I didn't use create-react-app. 

## Development
Run `npm install` to install all the packages plus all @types so Typescript wont yell at you at the start.

To start the client server to begin building your React app (with hot reload), run :

```
npm start

//--> Runs on port 8080
```
 
## Build

When you run `npm build` all the source code (`/src`) will be compiled and bundled into:

```
dist/ <-- Complied server-side HTML, CSS, JS code
```
